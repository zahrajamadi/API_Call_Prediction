# API Call Prediction in Malware Analysis

## Project Description

This project focuses on predicting upcoming API calls based on sequences of API calls related to the runtime behavior of malwares or benign applications (goodwares). The approach involves utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for feature generation and employing a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM) neural network for processing sequences and predicting the next API calls. This prediction can be indicative of the upcoming actions of a running application, aiding in early malware mitigation.

## How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zahrajamadi/API_Call_Prediction
   pip install -r requirements.txt
